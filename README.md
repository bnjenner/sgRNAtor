## Create Your own branch
All users working in their individual user directories should work on their own branch.
This prevents conflicts as we all work independently in the beginning stages of our
analysis.

To create and begin working on your branch, run this command.
```
git checkout -b $USER
```

After changes have been staged and commited, push to remote using this command.
```
git push origin $USER
```
